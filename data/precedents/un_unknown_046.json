STATE\nHOUSING\nCORPO\nPORATION\nLIMITED\nSHC\nANDHRA\n..\nPRADESH\n|Jagananna Sampoorna Gruha Haqq Scheme\nHousing Department, Government of Andhra Pradesh\nThis is a heartfelt letter to all my sisters, brothers and family members.\nBy the blessings of the people and the grace of God, our government is implementing many development programs for the welfare of the poor people of the state. With the aim of benefiting every poor person in the state, no matter how much financial burden, we are implementing the Navratnalu schemes continuously even in a disastrous situation like Corona. \"Jagananna Sampoorna Gruha Haqq Scheme\" is another huge scheme that has been implemented to provide complete rights to the poor people over their properties. 51.8 lakh families will benefit through this scheme.\nIn our state, documents related to lakhs of houses were lying in the offices of the housing development agency for decades after getting loans from the housing development agency. Thus, 39.5 lakh families got loans, interest rates increased, they could not pay the increased loan, and they lost the freedom to sell the property. Apart from these, another 12.3 lakh families are experiencing the experience of building houses with their own money. Such people are enjoying real estate but do not have the right to sell or mortgage it. During my long walk, it disturbed my mind to know that not only the debt burden of the loan recipients has increased, but they also do not have any rights over the house they have been living in for decades. Previous governments did not even think of waiver for decades, like this, our government waives 10,000/- crores and gives the registration document to the beneficiary, informing you how much waiver will be given. Keeping in mind the hardships of the poor people, it was decided to implement this scheme with the good intention of providing loan waiver and full rights to the house to those who paid the minimum amount decided by the government on time. This scheme was launched so that the beneficiaries who were allotted houses through the Andhra Pradesh State Housing Corporation would not only get loan waiver on their houses but also get registered documents and full rights to the house. Even though the One Time Settlement (OTS) was done before 2014, it was only interest waiver. But the actual payment had to be made. Although the mortgage papers were returned, full rights over the property were not granted."
