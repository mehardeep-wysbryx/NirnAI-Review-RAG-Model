  "review_notes": "L2 accepted with boundary mismatch note. Report correctly identified and disclosed the East/West boundary swap between Deed and EC in Additional Remarks. FI advised to obtain updated EC. This is a common data entry issue in EC portals - the property itself is correctly identified. RCC Slab house construction details (420 sq.m plinth) properly captured.",
  "exceptions": "Boundary mismatch between EC and Deed where boundaries are SWAPPED (East↔West or North↔South) is a known EC portal data entry issue - flag it but severity is MINOR if property otherwise matches. Do not flag as CRITICAL unless entire property description differs. 'Village Devata House' = 'God House' = same boundary reference.",
