In the said property acquired by us in the above manner, we have acquired a R.C.C. roof terrace with our own money. Having built the house and the house of the father-in-law, we have been enjoying the said property jointly with our full right of possession from that day to this day. However, rather than enjoying the said property jointly, it is better to divide it into shares and develop the property according to whose share it has come. Therefore, the said property has been divided into two unequal shares, A and B, in the order of good and bad, with the help of the elders, and it has been arranged that the first of us will take the share marked 'A' and the second of us will take the share marked 'B'. According to the said arrangement, the share marked 'A' and the second of us will take possession of the property according to whose share it has come. 1.
