Furthermore, due to the passage of time and the expiration of the limitation period, it is opined that no legal claim may arise on Their behalf. Hence we are proceeding with the report on this pretext. However, it is, advisable for F.I. to verify her age using a government-issued proof of age document. Further It is observed from the EC that the party names are reflected twice. Hence, the F.I. is required to verify the same and obtain an updated EC. Further It is to be noted that the online EC has been verified using the key parameters, namely the Document Number, Survey Number/House Number, and Split Survey/House Number of the concerned SRO, as per the Deed. However, cross-verification across multiple SROs has not been carried out due to the AP portal\u2019s requirement of separate passwords for each search parameter, and the OTP-based authentication mechanism makes searches across multiple SROs operationally infeasible.",
