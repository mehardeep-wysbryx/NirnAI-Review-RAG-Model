Yds) of the deed, it is, therefore advisable for F.I. to obtain updated EC as per Deed.\n\n2. It is to be noted that the online EC has been verified using the key parameters, namely the Document Number, Survey Number/House Number, and Split Survey/House Number of the concerned SRO, as per the Deed. However, cross-verification across multiple SROs has not been carried out due to the AP portal\u2019s requirement of separate passwords for each search parameter, and the OTP-based authentication mechanism makes searches across multiple SROs operationally infeasible.",
