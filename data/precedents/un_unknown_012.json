We are identical twins. The property as per the schedule below is the ancestral property of our father Vemagiri Ramulu, who enjoyed it with full rights till his lifetime and became intestate without writing any written documents. After his life, his wife Vemagiri Subbayamma, our mother, became intestate on 04-10-2018. Since the Varlas did not have any male child after the life of both of them, we, the female child of Varlas, inherited the property and have been enjoying it jointly with our full rights and possessions since that time till today. Since our family has grown, we are unable to enjoy the said property jointly, and with the opinion that for the betterment of each, they should enjoy it separately, according to this schedule, our joint family property, which we have been enjoying jointly till now, should be divided into two shares according to the elders for the well-being of our family. In the said shares, the property marked 'A' should be taken by the 1st of us, Mittapalli Venkatalakshmi, and the property marked 'B' should be taken by the 2nd of us, Kothtapalli Rani, and they should take possession of the property that has come to their respective shares. From this, they should enjoy the property that has come to their share with special rights, and they should pay all the taxes to be paid to the government separately, and they should enjoy it comfortably and freely with all the full rights of their sons and grandsons, by donating and selling it.\nFrom this, we will not be able to quarrel in the future with any kind of shares, whether there are ups and downs, or if there are any harms. Even if we do so, it will not be valid. We have no debts that have come from the world, nor any debts that we have to give to the world.\nFrom this, there is no relationship between one person's wealth and debts and the other's. \nA.
