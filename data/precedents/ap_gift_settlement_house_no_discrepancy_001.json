  "review_notes": "L2 accepted with discrepancy note. Report correctly identified that House No. 2-120 in EC is the residential address of the parties (Seedarapu family resides at 2-120), not the property's house number. The vacant land itself has no house number. FI advised to proceed per internal policy. Grama Panchayat certificate attached confirming property details.",
  "exceptions": "House number appearing in EC but not in Deed is acceptable when: (1) EC shows party's residential address, not property identifier, (2) Property is vacant land with no assigned house number. Do not flag as mismatch - just note for FI. Varalaxmi vs Varalakshmi spelling variation is acceptable Telugu transliteration.",
