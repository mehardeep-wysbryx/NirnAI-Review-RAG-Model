  "review_notes": "L2 accepted. Complete title chain verified via EC: Muthyalapalli Pullamma (2005) → Katta Peddiraju/Peddulu (via 299/2005) → Katta Poleramma (via 3906/2022). Alias name Peddiraju/Peddulu confirmed as same person. Property correctly described as 'located nearby House No. 4-76' - standard description for vacant land adjacent to existing house.",
  "exceptions": "Peddiraju vs Peddulu alias is acceptable - Telugu naming convention where formal name (Peddiraju) and common name (Peddulu) are used interchangeably. 'Located nearby House No. X' for vacant land is standard - do not flag as missing house number. 3+ year old deed - no issues with document age.",
  "flow_summary": "Muthyalapalli Pullamma etc. → Katta Peddiraju (via Sale Deed 299/2005 dated 10-01-2005) → Katta Poleramma (via Sale Deed 3906/2022 dated 15-09-2022). Clear two-step chain with link document properly reflected in EC."
