It is to be noted that the online EC has been verified using the key parameters, namely the Document Number, Survey Number/House Number, and Split Survey/House Number of the concerned SRO, as per the Deed. However, cross-verification across multiple SROs has not been carried out due to the AP portal\u2019s requirement of separate passwords for each search parameter, and the OTP-based authentication mechanism makes searches across multiple SROs operationally infeasible.\n\n2. It is noted that the Extent is handwritten in the the Annexure-1A, and hence the same may be verified by obtaining a Certified Copy from the concerned SRO, before proceeding to the loan process. Therefore, it is advisable for the F.I. to verify the same and proceed as per its internal policy",
