However, cross-verification across multiple SROs has not been carried out due to the AP portal\u2019s requirement of separate passwords for each search parameter, and the OTP-based authentication mechanism makes searches across multiple SROs operationally infeasible.\n\n2.It should be noted that the deed is executed by 2nd Donor representing himself as the Donee, thereby acting in a dual capacity, which constitutes a conflict of interest and is legally invalid. Therefore, it is advisable for the F.I. to verify the same and proceed as per its internal policy.",
