It is pertinent to note that Teddu Subramanyam was a minor at the time of the deed's registration, and court permission should have been obtained before executing the deed. However, he is now a major, and the F.I. has stated that he was included in the loan structure. Furthermore, due to the passage of time and the expiration of the limitation period, it is opined that no legal claim may arise on his behalf. Hence we are proceeding with the report on this pretext. However, it is, advisable for F.I. to verify his age using a government-issued proof of age document.\n\n2. It is to be noted that EC was not obtained with given survey number available in the given pledging deed, hence, EC is verified only through Document Number and Dismantled House Number not through property details. Hence, F.I. to verify the same. Further, It is to be noted that the online EC has been verified using the key parameters, namely the Document Number, and Split/House Number of the concerned SRO, as per the Deed. However, cross-verification across multiple SROs has not been carried out due to the AP portal\u2019s requirement of separate passwords for each search parameter, and the OTP-based authentication mechanism makes searches across multiple SROs operationally infeasible.",
