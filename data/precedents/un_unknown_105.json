However, cross-verification across multiple SROs has not been carried out due to the AP portal\u2019s requirement of separate passwords for each search parameter, and the OTP-based authentication mechanism makes searches across multiple SROs operationally infeasible. Further, The EC has been verified and downloaded using the property address parameter, as the option to retrieve EC records using the document number is currently unavailable in the Online EC portal. Thereupon, It is observed that house number is mentioned in Deed where as in EC house number is not reflecting, therefore it is advisable for F.I. to  update EC.\n",
