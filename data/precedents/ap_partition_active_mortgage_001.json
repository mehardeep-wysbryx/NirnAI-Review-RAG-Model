Multiple partition entries [A][B][C][D] for different schedules.",
  "review_notes": "L2 accepted as BT case. Report correctly identified: (1) Active mortgage with Vistaar Finance - internal BT, receipt deed not insisted, (2) Mutation not completed - tax still in deceased father Naragani Pydayya's name, (3) Death certificates for father attached (mother's DC not available but Saral policy relaxation applied), (4) Partition among family members with Schedule-C going to Veerababu. Conclusion correctly states 'Subject to Discharge of Active Mortgage'.",
  "exceptions": "For internal BT (mortgage with same FI): Do not insist on receipt deed - FI to verify internally. Tax receipt in deceased person's name is acceptable IF disclosed in report and FI advised to verify. Missing mother's death certificate acceptable under Saral policy. Multiple EC entries [A][B][C][D] for partition are normal - each schedule item gets separate entry.",
