We three are the only heirs. The said ancestral property of our mother, Ida Radhabai, has been kept as a joint property by our parents during their lives, and we are enjoying the fruits of it as a joint property. From now on, we will jointly enjoy the said property as a joint property. We do not want to keep it, but we think that it is beneficial for our families to develop the property that has come to us first, so we have divided it into three unequal shares as per the advice of our elders and have this deed of partition registered today. Therefore, the 1st of us, Eeda Shekhar Babu, will take the money of our joint family under the A-share below, the 2nd of us, Eeda Sudhakar Babu, will take the property under the B-schedule below, and the 3rd of us, Eeda Sunindra Babu, will take the property under the C-schedule below, and we have agreed to this deed of partition and have this deed of partition registered today. Therefore, whose share of the property They shall take possession of the said property with all rights on this day. Therefore, they shall from now on enjoy the property of their share, paying all revenue, government, panchayat taxes, etc., and their sons, grandsons, descendants, descendants, with the right to donate and sell it, with all rights. It is decided to eliminate all obstacles, disputes, disputes, and disputes arising from any cause regarding the said property, at their own expense, and to implement it without interruption according to this deed. It is also decided that these properties have not been subject to any mortgages, guarantees, purchase agreements, court seizures, etc., and that no other rights have been granted to these properties so far. We have written this deed of trust, stating that there are no tax arrears, that there are no heirs or beneficiaries to these properties except us, that there are no other movable assets to be shared except these properties. We have no debts to be paid by us as a joint family to the world, nor any debts to be received by our joint family from the world. Therefore, from now on, no one should have any financial debts but one should have no relationship with the financial debts of another. We should not have any disputes with each other regarding the re-distribution of these shares, whether there are any defects or fluctuations in their values. Even if such disputes are made, they will not be valid.\nThis A.P. 9/77 Act, assigned by the Government Not assets.
