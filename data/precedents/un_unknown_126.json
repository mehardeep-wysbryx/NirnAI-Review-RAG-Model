The property in the Schedule below is the ancestral property of the 1st of us and we have the right to co-parcenary in the said property as per the Hindu Succession Act and the property in the Schedule below is in our absolute possession till date and we are enjoying it jointly. There is also a highway of Rs. 2,00,000/- in cash on the common property. We think it is better to divide the said property into two unequal shares and get this partition deed registered. It is hereby resolved that the cash entered in Schedule A shall be taken by us 1, 2, and 3, namely Maddi Venkateswara Rao, Gidda Seetha Devi, and Lingampalli Seskumari, and the property entered in Schedule B shall be taken by us 4, Maddi Sombabu, and this divisional document shall be drawn up on this day. That is, the cash entered in Schedule A shall be taken by us 1, 2, and 3, and the property entered in Schedule B shall be taken by us 4 on this day itself. In addition, we shall be entitled to all the rights and duties of the property allocated to our shares, and shall enjoy them freely and happily, with all the rights of donation, exchange, sale, and inheritance, through our children and grandchildren. In so doing, we shall be able to settle all disputes arising from any source, with our own funds, and we shall be able to carry out this division without interruption. We shall not have any joint family property to share except these Scheduled Properties. We hereby confirm that there are no other claimants to the Scheduled Properties except ourselves, that the Scheduled Properties are undisputed properties that have not been encroached upon by anyone else up to date, that the survey numbers, boundaries and limits are correct, and that this division deed has been signed. We will never be able to argue with each other about the changes in the Scheduled Properties or the need to redistribute them, but even if we do so, it will not be valid according to law. From now on, there is no connection between the money and debts of one person and the other. Since the property is vacant, no Panchayat notices have been filed in this regard. I hereby declare that there are no trees, gardens, precious minerals, fish ponds, missionaries or mines in the land transferred in this deed and I hereby undertake to be liable to prosecution and to pay fine in case any such facts are found to have been concealed in this deed.\nM.
